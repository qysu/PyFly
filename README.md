# PyFly
I’ve wanted to visit Australia for as long as I can remember. But Sydney is literally one of the farthest places you could travel to from Toronto. Airfare is expensive, volatile, and complex to say the least. And that’s how I found myself here. The purpose of this study to analyze flight trends and develop ML models to predict the airfare from Toronto to Sydney up to thirty days in advance. At first, I wanted to predict the flight prices between one to thirty days, but I struggled to get a sensible R-squared value. Instead, I decided to predict whether I should buy or wait on any flight price in this time frame.
